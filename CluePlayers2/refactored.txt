This list is not comprehensive by any means:

1. Imported CR & PHKC config files and tests.
	- Exported board files to PDF for easier viewing.
2. Restructured file format for easier reading.
3. Reorganized Board file for easier reading:
	- Added comments for sections of code:
		+ Configuration file selection.
		+ Declarations of variables.
		+ Constructor with methods for loading configuration files. (ClueGameBoard Part I)
		+ Calculating targets methods. (ClueGameBoard Part II)
		+ Stubbed out section for CluePlayers.
		+ Main section, only to be used for debugging.
4. Fixed all warnings across all files, not suppress.
5. Aligned indentation, added whitespace, and what have you for easier readability in all files.
